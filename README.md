# FPGA-Stopwatch
Designed stopwatch in Verilog using behavioural logic. Broke it down to purely combinational logic and verified with testbenches. Mapped pins, uploaded to MAX10 FPGA device, tested correctness

Please open "FPGA Stopwatch" presentation for details.

Since this is an assessed university project, I can share the code only by request.
